				<h2>Portugal</h2>
				<p>I first went to Portugal when I was 5 years old.<br>
				We visited Opporto, Lisbon and Algarve.<br>
				The weather there is rerally nice. It is always sunny and warm.<br>
				I loved the food there.<br>
				I have visited Portugal at least 6 times since then.</br>
				I have swam with dolphins and done lots of shopping in Portugal.<br>
				Everytime I go, I get to have a whole new experience and I love it.</p>
			</div>
		  
		  
			<div class="column">
				<h2>Tenerife</h2>
				<p>I went to Tenerife 3 years ago. <br>
				I absolutely loved going to the beach there.<br>
				The sand in Tenerife is black.<br>
				Walking in Tenerife is so relaxing.<br>
				It is the perfect place for relaxation and I would completely recommend it.</p>
			</div>
		  
		  
			<div class="column">
				<h2>France</h2>
				<p>I went to Paris, France in 2016. We visited Disneyland while we were there.<br>
				I went up the Eiffel Tower too. The experience was unforgettable.<br>
				I could see all of Paris from the top. The food in Frnace is really good too.<br>
				I loved listening to the language. I learned a lot of french while I was there.</p>

			<div class="column">
				<h2>Gran Canaria</h2>
				<p>My family and I visit Gran Canaria every Summer. We always visit the <br>
				same place. The weather there is always really hot around 30â„ƒ. <br>
				The sea is also warm there and we have to walk from place to place since<br>
				we don't hire a car when we go over. I love it there. It has a peaceful and<br>
				friendly atmosphere. They also understand English there<br>
				The hotel we usually go is very nice, it has a jacuzzi and big pool, aswell <br>
				as poker table and other types of fun games.

			<div class="column">
				<h2>Poland</h2>
				<p>I visited Poland for the first time last February. We went to Krakow.<br>
				It had been snowing for the last few weeks before we went so everywhere we went was full of snow.<br>
				I tried skiing with my dad. It was great fun. We spent the whole day on the mountain trying to perfect our skiing method.<br>
				In the other days we spent our time making snowmen and sliding down snow hills.<br>
				There was a really good pizza place near where we were staying and we went to it every second day.<br>
				It was a great trip.</p>
			</div>
		  
		  
			<div class="column">
				<h2>Australia</h2>
				<p>My family and i also visited Australia for 2 weeks last October.<br>
				We went to Sydney Opera House. It was amazing looking at the big building in person.<br>
				The weather was lovely when we went over. The australian accent is really nice.<br>
				The food was good too. The people there are very nice.<br>
				The beaches are amazing.</p>
