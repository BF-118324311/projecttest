                            There were 20 other girls who played it with me. Our coaches name was Orla. She was very nice.
                            We had matches every Sunday and played against teams from other areas.</p>

                        My coaches name was Andrea. We wore shorts and basketball shirts. There were 25 girls on the team.
                        It is a very good sport and really improves your fitness level.</p>

                        The type of karate I did was Funokoshi Shotokan Karate. 
                        I went to England to represent the team in an international competition being held there.
                        I made some great friends and learned a lot of self defence moves.</p>

                        I absolutely loved swimming. Its a good skill to have. It is also a good low impact exercise.
                        I used to have a black and pink swim suit that I loved and a black cap.
                        I went to swimming lessons from the age of 5 to 13.</p>
