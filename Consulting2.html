				<h2>Blockchain</h2>
				<p>Blockchain is far more than just the technology underlying Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency. 
                                    It is a tool that promises to decentralize the structures governing all economic transactions and, 
                                    in the process, redefine our concept of trust.
                                    This is the most revolutionary and innovative aspect of blockchain.<br>

				<h2>Autonomous Things</h2>
				<p>In recent years, we have seen robots, drones, cars, appliances and other types of autonomous things 
                                    perform tasks that would normally be performed by humans.
                                    we expect a shift from stand-alone intelligent things to a swarm of collaborative 
                                    intelligent things, with multiple devices working together, either independently of people or with human input.
                                    Here are some examples of how autonomous things are being used: <br>
                                    - Intelâ€™s use of a drone swarm for the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games in 2018. <br>
                                    - A plan for Dubai to use autonomous police vehicles that can deploy their own drones for surveillance. <br>

				<h2>Immersive Experience</h2>
				<p>Training, learning, and exploring in three dimensions.
                                   Immersive experience can create digital environments for humans to experience the impossible. 
                                   Through a mix of data science, artificial intelligence, and creativity, virtual and 
                                   augmented reality offers the opportunity to train and plan in a safe environment, without consequences. 
                                   From battlefield simulations to hospital management scenarios, this technology better prepares teams for mission success.<br>
